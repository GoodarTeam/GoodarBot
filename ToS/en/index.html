		<h1>GoodarBot Terms of Service</h1>
		<h3>Last Updated: September 13, 2023</h3>
		<h2>Proper Usage</h2>
		<p>
		GoodarBot was created in order to perform certain actions on our server, such as checking promocodes*, sending a complaint through its own form and showing statistics about our GoodarTeam team and is intended for our “GoodarTeam” server.
		</p>

		<p>
		GoodarBot stores message IDs and user IDs for stable operation of its own complaint form. We will ONLY store these IDs if the bot requires them to perform actions on our “GoodarTeam” server. After submitting your own complaint form, the saved specified identifiers are deleted.
		</p>

		<p>
		* - In the YouTube channel GoodarTeam videos, sometimes there are hidden promocodes that need to be entered using the slash command “/promocode” or via “!promocode”; they can be one-time or reusable, for which they get a cool prize on our server at the discretion of the administration.
		</p>
